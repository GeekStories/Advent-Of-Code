### Advent of Code
This is the repo I will use to store the code I write for the Advent of Code challenges. Python will be my main drive for the majority of these however I may also use other languages later on.

### 2024
This is my first year participating! I hope to continue for many more years, and maybe catchup on previous ones (if I can find the time)
